Remediation steps for installation docker on Vagrant box(Ubuntu 14.04 x64):

*We should edit the vagrantfile by using below commands*

Here we can directly use shell script in vagrantfile or we can run single command as individually 

#config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
    
    sudo apt-get update     
    
    sudo apt-get install -y lxc
    
    sudo apt-get install -y wget
    
    sudo wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sudo bash
    
    sudo apt-get install -y curl
    
    sudo apt-get install -y git    
    
This part is optional:

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a Compose file to configure your application’s services.
Using Compose is basically a three-step process.
1. Define your app’s environment with a Dockerfile so it can be reproduced anywhere.
2. Define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so they can be run together in an isolated environment.
3. Lastly, run docker-compose up and Compose will start and run your entire app

sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.3.0/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

  SHELL
  


After installation docker we will receive this message:

If you would like to use Docker as a non-root user, you should now consider
adding your user to the "docker" group with something like:

  sudo usermod -aG docker your-user

Remember that you will have to log out and back in for this to take effect!

WARNING: Adding a user to the "docker" group will grant the ability to run
         containers which can be used to obtain root privileges on the
         docker host.
         Refer to https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface
         for more information.
